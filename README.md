mlx library project with the central notion of raycasting

It is a typical 42 C project where the goal is to write code with no more than 25 lines per function, 5 declarations per function, and only one argument passed to mlx draw function. Due to that everything resides in the structure of type t_all. While the goal of these rules is clear, the implications are not justified. For me, at this point of time, the code is very unreadable with those limitations.

Beware everyone who would like to try and read it.
